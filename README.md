# Editorial Emails

**Note, this service is not currently running, although it was successfully used
for numerous A/B tests in Q3 2019/20. It also represents a useful reference
point for understanding the vagaries of HTML emails. See the `Project Status`
section below for more info if you want to resurrect.**

A prototype service to render editorial emails.

The motivation is to create something that is decoupled from the main Frontend
repo so that we can move faster.
