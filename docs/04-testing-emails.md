# Testing emails

## How do we do this

We haven't decided yet but there are a couple of options:

- With [Litmus](https://www.litmus.com/pre-send-testing/)
- With [Email on Acid](https://www.emailonacid.com/)
- Braze provides a comprehensive visual testing solution called _Inbox Vision_. [Follow our guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zXUq2BIVEVEj0zolB77tskO0bvtVkB3CWj8eaiADMCo/) (internal document) on how to visually test your emails using Braze.
